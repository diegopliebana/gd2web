<b>Summary:</b> Game Design (Part II) extends the principles of game Design studied in Part I with the latest <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
techniques. This part of the module will cover state of the art AI methods that can be used for <b>automatic game tuning</b>, 
<b>game design</b>, and <b>testing</b> using AI agents and methods. During this module, you will learn these techniques, design your 
own game, participate in an AI hack (prizes available) and conduct <b>user trials</b> to evaluate your design. Finally, you 
will write all your work and experiments in a scientific paper and receive feedback in order to help you submit it to
a conference.

The theme of this part of the course is AI Informed Game Design. The main aim is use AI 
to make better games, though attention will also be given to how we can design games to 
test important aspects of AI. What "better" means in this context can be hard to pin down, 
and in everyday terms is anyway a subjective measure. To make this more objective we'll 
consider aspects of player experience that can be measured and optimised. Since getting 
human players to play through games can be expensive and time consuming, we'll look at 
using software agents to automatically play test games, in addition to using human play-testing.<br><br>

A key aspect of the course is to consider how the design space of a class of games can be
defined using appropriate data or program structures and then explored using automated search
algorithms. Depending on how generally the search space is defined this approach can either 
be used to generate novel games, or it can be used to find the best set of parameters for 
a particular game.<br><br>

The course will be taught with a mixture of lectures, labs (including game AI competitions), 
group work and invited talks.<br>

         <p>The relevance of this is to generate a diverse set of agents to automatically 
play-test a game. This section will consider ways to quickly generate a number 
of reasonable performance AI players with relatively little effort. You may have 
already have covered many or even all the techniques below, but much can be 
learned by applying them to different games: there's still much to be learned 
regarding which methods work best and why:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Monte Carlo Tree Search</li>
	<li>Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms</li>
	<li>Video Game Description Language (VGDL) and General Video Game AI</li>
</ul>
<p>To study aspects of game design spaces and game AI we'll use some (possibly 
all) of the following (you may also be able to use your own examples)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flappy Bird</li>
	<li>"Space battle"</li>
	<li>Asteroids</li>
	<li>Planet wars</li>
</ul>
<p>Experimental work will be based on a simple version of Asteroids and a 
two-player version we call Space Battle (all written in Java), and also GVGAI.</p>
<p>For some of the games used, reasonably efficient source code will be provided 
that can be run headless thousands of times faster than real time, enabling 
simulation-based search to be used to implement AI controllers.</p>
<p>To test the various AI approaches mini-competitions will be run to see which 
team can generate the best performing AI, or the AI which best optimises some 
aspect of player experience.</p>

            <b>Tristan Cazenave</b></font><font size="2"> is a Professor of artificial intelligence 
            at LAMSADE Universite Paris-Dauphine. Author of more than a hundred scientific papers about artificial 
            intelligence in games. He started to publish commercial video games when he was aged 16 and co-founded 
            a successful web agency in 1992.<br>
            <b>Seminar:</b> Monte Carlo Tree Search combines random games with state dependent statistics. We will 
            briefly recall UCT the standard Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and we will show various improvements 
            that make use of different kinds of statistics to improve random games. Both game specific and general 
            heuristics enable to improve much the level of play compared to standard UCT. The GRAVE heuristic helps 
            improving the choices of moves for already visited states, the PPAF heuristic improves the playout policy 
            online and the SHOT algorithm makes use of bandits that minimize the simple regret instead of the cumulative 
            regret as UCT does. We will also review recent advances in Deep Learning for computer Go.
